![USA 2026](https://img.shields.io/badge/USA%202026-black) ![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Patrick Wardle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Patrick%20Wardle-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [Practical Ransomware Detection on macOS (via Math, not AI)](https://github.com/objective-see/RansomWhere)  
📝 **Description:** RansomWhere? is a free, open-source tool that generically detects and stops macOS ransomware by observing the behaviour common to nearly every variant: rapidly transforming user files into encrypted data. Built on Apple's Endpoint Security framework, it applies entropy-based analysis to separate benign file activity from encryption and simple mathematical heuristics to distinguish encrypted data from compressed data. The approach uses no signatures and no machine learning, and has been tested against real macOS ransomware samples.

![USA 2026](https://img.shields.io/badge/USA%202026-black) ![Category: 🧠 Reverse Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🧠%20Reverse%20Engineering-orange) ![Gun Rui Tew](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gun%20Rui%20Tew-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [SEmuRAI: Software Emulation and Reversing AI Agent](https://github.com/DevNerdGR/SEmuRAI-mcp)  
📝 **Description:** SEmuRAI is a dynamic analysis toolkit that gives LLM-driven reverse engineering agents sandboxed binary emulation, including breakpoints and memory and register read/write access. Agentic reverse engineering workflows typically rely on static analysis alone, which struggles with obfuscated or large binaries stripped of contextual information. Benchmarks across three test cases of increasing complexity compared static-only analysis against the combined setup and found that adding SEmuRAI improved agent performance, particularly on the harder tasks.
